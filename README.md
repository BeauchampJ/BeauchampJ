# About Me
Hi there! My name is Jacob Beauchamp and I'm a student pursuing a bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering at Colorado State University. I teach two engineering/coding classes where students learn about arduino and algorithm development in MATLAB. Additionally, while not present on my Github, I have plenty of experience coding in industry with MATLAB in controls design and development.

I'm proficient in MATLAB, Simulink, Python, Arduino/C++, G-Code and Shell Scripting. I have a variety of projects ranging from school to personal.
